# Updates

## Jalynn: 1.29.25

* Created a 'testing_notebook' branch as I am not familiar with local Jupyter - What can I say, I liked Google Colab
* Successfully set up my local Jupyter Notebook / Lab! 
* * Created 'J_workload_classification.ipynb'
* Attempted to pull .mat file directly in Python - No luck of course
* * Added Jame's 'Data_fNIRS_Clean_23'
* Went straight into Matlab and exported the data as CSVs
* * Created a new Matlab script called 'export_hb_filt_to_csv.m'
* * Exported 'demographics.csv' - Not sure if we'll use it
* * Exported each participant's data individually as CSV in the 'data_csvs' folder
* Imported data to 'participant_data' dictionary back in Python
